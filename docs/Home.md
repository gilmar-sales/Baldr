# Welcome to Baldr's documentation!

**Baldr** is a lightweight and modern C++ microframework designed for building scalable and secure HTTP servers with an expressive and composable architecture. It is inspired by contemporary web frameworks, offering high-performance abstractions, robust dependency injection, and middleware support out of the box.

Whether you're creating REST APIs, backend services, or embedded control interfaces, Baldr empowers C++ developers to write clean and modular server-side applications.

## Key Features

- 🧱 **Compositional HTTP Server** with routing, request/response lifecycle, and middleware.
- ⚙️ **Dependency Injection Container** for clean architecture and testability.
- 🧵 **Session and Logging Middleware** included by default.
- 🧼 **Modern C++ APIs** using smart pointers, `std::function`, and RAII patterns.
- 🚀 **Zero-overhead abstractions** with performance in mind.
- 🧩 **Easily extensible** using your own components and middlewares.
